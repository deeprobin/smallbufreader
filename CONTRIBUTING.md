# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you so much for helping with this project. To create some uniformity, there are a few guidelines to follow.

## Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Limit the first line to max. 70 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

## Rust Code Style

Before committing, the code must be properly formatted and all clippy-issues must be resolved.

- Run `cargo fmt`
- Run `cargo clippy` and fix issues
